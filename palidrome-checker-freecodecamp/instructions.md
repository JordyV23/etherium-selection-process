# Instructions

## Build a Palindrome Checker

A **palindrome** is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

> **Note**: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build an app that is functionally similar to [this one](https://palindrome-checker.freecodecamp.rocks).

### âœ… User Stories

- You should have an input element with an id of `text-input`.
- You should have a button element with an id of `check-btn`.
- You should have a `div`, `span` or `p` element with an id of `result`.
- If the input is empty when clicking the button, an alert should say: **"Please input a value."**
- Example results when valid input is checked:
  - `A` âžœ **A is a palindrome**
  - `eye` âžœ **eye is a palindrome**
  - `_eye` âžœ **_eye is a palindrome**
  - `race car` âžœ **race car is a palindrome**
  - `not a palindrome` âžœ **not a palindrome is not a palindrome**
  - `A man, a plan, a canal. Panama` âžœ **A man, a plan, a canal. Panama is a palindrome**
  - `never odd or even` âžœ **never odd or even is a palindrome**
